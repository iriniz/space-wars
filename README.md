This is my first project on unity where i didn't use any tutorials! I'm planning on adding more features in the future (visible hp, a point system, different types of enemies that follow a sequence including a final boss, and powerups!)

To run the game, download the folder "Demo" and run the "Space Game" exe. (You need to restart the simulator in order to replay)
